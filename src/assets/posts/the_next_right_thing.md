It's been hard to get started. So much going on.

But as Frozen 2 teaches us, at times like this the only thing to do is _the next right thing_.

Or if Dalinar is more your style, the most important step is the next one.

For me, then, that means posting. Just posting. Just do a post. A single post.

__This post__.

Don't overthink it.

Don't try to redesign the blog (I hate my current design).

Don't wait until I have blog-post-NFTs (yes I want to do this).

Don't wait for a "great" post (I have lots of ideas for great long-form, no time to actually write them).

Just do the next right thing. Take the next step.
