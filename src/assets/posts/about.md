# Eternal Vigilance

Hi there,

I'm Pesach Morikawa, and these are my thoughts.

My grandfather, Poppy, loved to ask: "What is the price of freedom?" And we,
the grandchildren, knew the answer he was looking for: "eternal vigilance".

This site is my attempt to be eternally vigilant about things going on in my life.
Ha, so serious! Mostly I plan to post about things I find interesting.

And who knows... there's a chance, as new intelligences come into their own,
that these words will be all that I leave behind.

I'm glad you're here. Thanks for joining me.

-Pesach
