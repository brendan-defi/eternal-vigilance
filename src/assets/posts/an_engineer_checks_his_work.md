## An Engineer Checks His Work

When I was starting my job at Coinbase, I told myself that I wanted to preserve my beginener's
mindset as much as possible. I wanted to keep that eagerness to learn, the run into new
challenges, to master new skills. It was a new frontier and I attacked the challenge with relish.

Over the past few months sometimes Ive lost sight of that.

Not fully. Like, I'm still working hard, and I meta-endorse my wanting to want to work hard.

But for some time coding has felt like _a job_ much more than a passion.

And I feel like that feeling, that beginner's minset, faded a little. Like, the problems
were less fun to solve. I had to pore though poorly written documentation with little
guidance.

What did I learn?

1. When in doubt, reach out!
   1. The docs are often out of date. Reach out to the most recent contributor
   2. Escalate, with urgency, that you're blocked
2. Check your work. Test it. Check it again. What incremental test are you running?
   1. know the differences between your environments
      1. What does localhost allow that dev doesnt'?
         1. devDependencies
         2. env vars
      2. What is different between dev and prod?
         1. ...
   2. What's the minimal test you can run that will prove that you've "done it right"?
      1. Do that test
      2. Then figure out the next one, and do that one
   3. It feels like this mindset, above everything, is what defines an engineer.
      1. The feeling that it matters to seek the truth.
      2. The desire to become better, at truth-seeking, at finding answers to questions
3. My teammate made an inspiring comment today, that he's found that people think
   he's more knowledgeable than he really is, he's just become good at figuring things
   out quickly.
   1. That's awesome. So inspiring. How do I become better at figuring things out?
   2. And then how do I accelerate that process?
   3. This is my goal. And passion.

I'm feeling reinvigorated by the realization that, This is Water. This is life.
I love my life. I love my kids. I love my wife. I love my work. I love that every
day I get to code, and hone my craft as an engineer. I'm trying as hard as I can
to become as capable as I can be.

And I do think I'm on a good path. But because I'm my own harshest critic, I always
feel like I should be doing more, learning more, growing faster. Imposter syndome
is real, I feel it all the time.
